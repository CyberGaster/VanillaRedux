# Vanilla Redux

This mod for Balatro completely changes the balance of the game: many jokers and other elements have been reworked and updated. The changes affect not only individual stuff, but also the overall dynamics — familiar tactics require rethinking, and in their place new opportunities for strategies and experiments appear. As a result, each game feels fresh and new, and the gameplay itself becomes more intense and interesting.

This mod is in early beta testing.

- Updated 6 spectral, 2 tarot, and 2 enhanced cards
